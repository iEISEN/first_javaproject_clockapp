# ⏰ Clock App 

This is my **CSE 1116 – Object Oriented Programming Laboratory Project**,  
completed in the **Summer 222 Trimester** at **United International University (UIU)**.  

It was my **first Java application**, developed in **NetBeans using Java Swing GUI**.  
The project features a **real-time digital clock** that displays accurate system time using threads, along with additional tools like a **Stopwatch**, **Alarm**, **Timer**, and **Counter** — all integrated into a clean, interactive interface.
